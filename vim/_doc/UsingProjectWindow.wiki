= Using Project Window =

== Create project tree ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you running a new project through vimentry file, you will have a blank vertical 
window at the left side, that is exProject window.

By default, you can use `\C` or `\R` to create project tree in exProject window. The 
`\C` will create the project tree with asking dialog, but `\R` will ignore the dialog
asking step and using the setted file filter and dir filter to create the project tree
(*NOTE:* if nothing setted yet, it will use default file and dir filter ). When use `\C` 
method (*NOTE:* the \C here means first press key `\`, then press `shift + c` ( which 
means the uppercase "c"), it is important to known that vim's operations is case sensitive, 
same as `\R` ), there will show up 3 dialogs asking you input the proper value:

The first one is the root path dialog, which will let you input the path of the directory
you want to start like the picture below:

[[res/exProject.RootPath.Dialog.png]]

The second one is the file filters dialog, which will let you input the suffix of files 
you wish to see in exProject window. 

[[res/exProject.FileFilter.Dialog.png]]

The third one is the dir filters dialog, which will let you input the sub-directory names 
under the root path, and the exVim will ignore the directory not in the filter.

[[res/exProject.DirFilter.Dialog.png]]


*NOTE:* the syntax of file filter and dir filter are:

{{{
filter = item1,item2,item3...
}}}

No matter which kind of method you use (`\C` or `\R`) to create project tree, after generating 
the project tree, you will see a similar scene like the picture below:

[[res/exProject.Window.png]]

The first two line records the file filter and dir filter you've input before. ( NOTE: if you 
use `\R`, it use the default internal filter settings write in exVim ). You can change the value
in it without trigger those dialogs, and when you save the file, it will apply the new filters 
so that you can easily use `\R` to refresh the whole project based on them.

The line with prefix `[F]` represent a folder/directory. 

The other line represent files. And the first character of the file suffix will be the character 
inside `[]`. The exProject window support different highlight for some special suffix, like 
.h, .cpp. You could add your own file suffix highlight in exProject. 

== NULL type file filter ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some times we may want to add files without suffix, for example: Makefile, configure and
thoes old c/pp project write source code without suffix. In this case, if you have file
filter in your project, it will skip to add these files. In order to let the files without 
suffix can be add into project, the exVim define NULL filter for these files. So you can 
write the filter below to add the empty suffix files:

{{{
filter = NULL,item1,item2,...
}}}

*NOTE:* the NULL must write in uppercase.

== Folding the directory ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are able to fold a directory by moving the cursor to the line of directory and 
pressing `<Enter>`, also press `<Enter>` on a folded line will lead to unfold.

[[res/exProject.fold.png]]

You can use the full vim fold command under exProject window, for example: 
 * To fold up the whole project, you can use zM, and use zO to unfold all, or use zr to unfold a level.
 * When you are inside a directory ( your cursor are not in the line of the directory name but in the line of the file of the directory ). You can use zc and zo for folding a single directory.
 * You can use zk,zj to move between folds. ( The exProject provide `<ctrl-k>` and `<ctrl-j>` for easy moving around the directory )

== Moving around in exProject window ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically you use h,j,k,l or arrow keys to move up and down in project window.  exProject
provide several feature to help moving easily for different purpose.

To move around the directory, you can use `<ctrl-k>` and `<ctrl-j>` no matter where your
cursor are.

If you are careful enought, you can see in every lines of directory, there have a single 
`{` at the end of the line. And it would have another one `}` at last file in this folder. 
As the picture shows below:

[[res/exProject.Directory.Mark.Pair.png]]

*NOTE:* There have two `}` at the end of text `FileUtility.h`, and that is becuase the
`FileUtility.h` is in the path of `platform/win32/` and it happend to be the last file 
in these two folders.

You can use these brackets to help you move around between a folder, so that you can know 
where is the end/beginning of the directory.

To move around a folder, try pressing `%` when your cursor are at the bracket mark. Also
you can try `[{` and `]}` when you are inside a folder.

When you edit a file in edit window, and you want to locate the file in project window, 
try `\fc`, this operation will let the exVim search the file in project window, and if
found, move the cursor to the exact position in exProject window.

[[res/exProject.leader.fc.png]]

== Open and edit files ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can open a file in edit window through exProject by pressing `<enter>` on the file line.
Also you can try open it in a split window by pressing `<shift-enter>` on the file line.

When yo press `<shift-enter>` on the directory line, it will open a command window with
the path of the directory to help you do some operation outside exVim. Shows like the picture
below:

[[res/exProject.Popup.Terminal.png]]

TODO: the exProject can let you define open behavior for different filetype. currently it
just internal define two additional behavior for `.exe` and `.err`. For `.exe` it try to run it.
For `.err` it will call exQuickFix to open up a window and load the errors into it.


== Create new file or folder ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a new file in exProject window, you can move your cursor under a file line or a
directory line, and press `<o>`. After that yo will see a line with mark `|-[]` under your
cursor like the picture shows below:

[[res/exProject.prepare.new.file.png]]

Change to insert mode, and type the filename with the suffix you expect to create the new
file. For example I type `NewFileMng.h`. It is ok to leave the `[]` empty without a file
type character. When you finish filename, press `<enter>` to open the new file in edit window,
and save it to complete the file.

(*NOTE:* the file will be created under the directory if you press `<o>` on a directory 
line, or under the file with same directory if you press `<o>` on a file line ).

To create a new folder in exProject window, you can move your cursor under a directory line, 
and press `<O>`. After that you will see a line with mark `|-[F] { }` under your at the line
above your cursor like the picture shows below:

[[res/exProject.prepare.new.folder.png]]

Change to insert mode, and fill up the directory name right behind `[F]`. 

(*NOTE:* actually, the feature never done, it create the directory virtually. That means if
you don't create the directory with same path same name manually in your file system, it will
never be access in exProject. )

TODO: The create directory feature may be changed in future version. Which will first popup a 
dialog let you input the directory name, so that exProject can use that name create directory
by mkdir() function. Any better idea send mail to me.

== refresh local folder ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you do some file operation (add,remove,rename files) outside exVim, you probably like
to sync it in exProject window. But use `\R` lead to refresh the whole project. 

Sometimes we just like to refresh a single directory, and `\r` will help you fulfill the
task. By move your cursor under/inside a directory, and press `\r`, it will only refresh
the directory your cursor in.

(*NOTE:* this also helpful when you use `<o>` to add several files. it will refresh them by
automatically fill the filetype in the `[]`, and sort them in the directory ).

== Settings ==
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [[exProject]] chapter introduces all the things you can set for exProject.
